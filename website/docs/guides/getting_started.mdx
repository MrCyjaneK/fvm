If you're working with multiple Flutter projects or if you're a Flutter plugin developer who often has to test your plugins with various versions of Flutter SDK, then you know how critical it is to efficiently manage different Flutter versions.

This guide will show you how to get started using the Flutter Version Management tool, or FVM for short.

### 1. Install FVM

To get started, we first need to install FVM. FVM is a simple tool that allows us to manage multiple versions of the Flutter SDK on a per-project basis. You can install it using the following command:

<InstallationTabs />

#### Verify FVM installation by running:

```shell
$ fvm --version
```

This should output the version of your FVM installation.

### 2. Configure your project

Once installed, navigate towards your Flutter project. Here, we can use FVM to install the Flutter SDK version we want for this project:

```shell
$ cd your_project
$ fvm use stable
```

This will use the 'stable' version of the Flutter SDK locally in your project. If version is not yet installed you will be prompted.

To list all the Flutter versions that are installed in your project, run:

```shell
$ fvm list
```

### 3. Switch between versions

To change to a different Flutter version, you can use the following command:

```shell
$ fvm use beta
```

This will switch the Flutter version of your project to 'beta'.

### 4. Run flutter commands

After successfully switching to your desired version, you can now run the project:

```shell
$ fvm flutter run
```

Using the `fvm flutter run` command instead of the usual `flutter run` ensures you're using the correct Flutter version for the project.

And that's it! You've successfully installed FVM, used it to manage multiple Flutter versions for your project, switched between versions, and ran your project with a specified Flutter version.

Remember, you can refer to the FVM official documentation for a full list of commands and options. Happy coding!
